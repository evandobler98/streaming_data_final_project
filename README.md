# streaming_data_final_project

My custom consumer listens to the "baseball-updates" Kafka topic and processes live baseball game events. It maintains a cumulative score for each team, updates a visual scoreboard, and stores the data in SQLite for future reference. The scoreboard dynamically updates with team colors, inning progress, and real-time game events such as home runs and strikeouts. At the end of each game, it declares the winner in bold on the scoreboard and resets for the next match.

## Task 1. Manage Local Project Virtual Environment

1. Create your .venv
2. Activate .venv
3. Install the required dependencies using requirements.txt.

## Task 2. Start Zookeeper and Kafka (Takes 2 Terminals)

If Zookeeper and Kafka are not already running, you'll need to restart them.
See instructions at [SETUP-KAFKA.md] to:

1. Start Zookeeper Service ([link](https://github.com/denisecase/buzzline-02-case/blob/main/docs/SETUP-KAFKA.md#step-7-start-zookeeper-service-terminal-1))
2. Start Kafka Service ([link](https://github.com/denisecase/buzzline-02-case/blob/main/docs/SETUP-KAFKA.md#step-8-start-kafka-terminal-2))

## Task 3. Start a New Streaming Application

This will take two more terminals:

1. One to run the producer which writes messages. 
2. Another to run the consumer which reads messages, processes them, and writes them to a data store. 

### Producer (Terminal 3) 

Start the producer to generate the messages. 
The existing producer writes messages to a live data file in the data folder.
If Zookeeper and Kafka services are running, it will try to write them to a Kafka topic as well.
For configuration details, see the .env file. 

In VS Code, open a NEW terminal.
Use the commands below to activate .venv, and start the producer. 

Windows:

```shell
.venv\Scripts\activate
py -m producers.producer_case
```

Mac/Linux:
```zsh
source .venv/bin/activate
python3 -m producers.producer_case
```

The producer will still work if Kafka is not available.

### Consumer (Terminal 4) - Two Options

Start an associated consumer. 
You have two options. 
1. Start the consumer that reads from the live data file.
2. OR Start the consumer that reads from the Kafka topic.

In VS Code, open a NEW terminal in your root project folder. 
Use the commands below to activate .venv, and start the consumer. 

Windows:
```shell
.venv\Scripts\activate
py -m consumers.kafka_consumer_case
OR
py -m consumers.file_consumer_case
```

Mac/Linux:
```zsh
source .venv/bin/activate
python3 -m consumers.kafka_consumer_case
OR
python3 -m consumers.file_consumer_case
```


## Save Space
To save disk space, you can delete the .venv folder when not actively working on this project.
You can always recreate it, activate it, and reinstall the necessary packages later. 
Managing Python virtual environments is a valuable skill.
